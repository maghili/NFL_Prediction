# NFL_Prediction
Here we work with the historic data that is provided by FiveThirtyEight, on the historical predictions by ELO since 1920 <a href = "https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nfl-elo">here</a>. The predictions are not 100 percent accurate, but as a project what I want to do is to use the historical data to teach the machine and find the outcome of the future games given that I know what is ELO predictions.
In fact if we do some data analysis we find that the accuracy of ELO prediction is `65.352658212`, and it has a decreasing trend.
